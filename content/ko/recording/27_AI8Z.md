AI8Z 2024년 12월 10일 교신

아마추어무선은 전세계의 햄들과 대화를 나누는 취미라고 말은 하지만 실제 외국의 햄들과 교신을 하면서 대화다운 대화를 나누는 경우는 그리 많지 않습니다. 대부분 신호리포트/이름/위치/날씨 정도의 정보만 교환하는 교신이 전부입니다.

언어의 벽이 있긴 하지만 이런 틀에 박힌 교신에서 벗어나기 위해서 나름대로 노력을 해 보고 있습니다. 최근에는 전신에서도 영문 래그츄를 하려는 노력을 좀 더 적극적으로 시도하고 있습니다. 하지만 저의 노력과 달리 전신에서 래그츄를 하려는 상대를 만나기가 쉽지 않습니다. 아마 한국과 교신하기 위해서 기다리는 사람이 많다고 생각하여 장시간 교신에 부담을 느끼는 모양입니다.

마침 오늘 아침에 28MHz에서 미국의 햄들이 오랫동안 래그츄를 나누는 신호를 들었습니다. 두 사람 모두 신호가 좋았습니다. 교신이 끝나는 것을 듣고 그 중 한 사람을 호출하여 약 1시간 정도 영문 래그츄를 재미있게 나누었습니다.

비영어권 사람에게 영문 전신은 수신보다 송신이 어렵습니다. 문장을 구성하는 것도 어렵지만, 긴 단어가 나오면 머리 속으로 스펠링을 생각하면서 제대로 송신하기가 쉽지 않습니다. 그래서 평소의 교신속도보다 느리게 약 20wpm의 속도로 교신하고 있습니다.

다시 녹음 파일을 들으면서 아래와 같이 텍스트로 작성하였습니다. 문장을 줄여서 하기 때문에 일부는 문법에 맞지 않는 것도 있습니다. 더구나 저의 송신에는 틀린 문장도 있습니다. 영문 전신의 래그츄는 어떻게 이루어지는지 참고로 보시기 바랍니다. 교신의 뒷 부분 일부가 녹음이 되지 않았지만 기억을 더듬어서 작성하였습니다.
